# URL Shortener Microservice

This project was done as a part of Backend development and APIs course on Freecodecamp and is a exact replica of [https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/).

There will be examples on the site on how to use the api.

You can write the url in the input field and click POST button. Then the request will be received by the server, and it sends a json containing short url. You can use the shortend url as 'https://url-shortener-microservice-project.sathishkannan16.repl.co/api/shorturl/{short url}. 

The project is hosted on replit: [https://url-shortener-microservice-project.sathishkannan16.repl.co/](https://url-shortener-microservice-project.sathishkannan16.repl.co/).
